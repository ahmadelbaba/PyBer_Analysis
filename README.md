# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
#### We're tasked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then we'll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally,we will summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.



## Ride Sharing Summary by City Type:

## Results:

### Urban riders generate the most revenue with the lowest fare/ride and fare/driver. Interestingly there are more urban drivers than rides. This is in contrast to suburan and rural cities where there were less drivers than rides. For urban and rural cities fares/ride and fares/driver were higher. 

## Total Fare by City Type:

## Results:

### Looking at the line charts for the first 5 months of the year we can see variability in fares across all three types of cities. It seems like variability is in the nature of this ride sharing business. 

## Recommendations:
- Adjust fare by demand to accomodate for variability in ridesharing
- Adjust fare by city type (e.g. lower the fare in urban or rural cities)
- Sign up more drivers in rural and suburban cities
